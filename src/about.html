        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
            Our vision is to have a proactive community working together to make the most of the local talent and resources. We believe that by empowering individuals and groups to take action, we can create positive change and make our community a better place.

        <h3>Florin County Council</h3>
        <p>
            This project is setup and funded by the Florin County Council. Budgetary pressure put a number of public services in a precarious position. The council realised that the local community has a huge amount of skill, knowledge and time which is being underutilised when it comes to building a community. And thus, eco.io was born.
        </p>
        <h3>Your involvement</h3>
        <p>
            Community involvement is the key to this project project. Without the volunteers, there would be no projects. 
            <ol>
                <li type="1">
                    You can browse existing projects, which are launched either by other members of the community or Florin County Council, to see whether there are any you would like to attend.
                </li>
                <li type="1">
                    If you have an idea for a social good project in your community, you can launch your own event to attract volunteers and potential interest from the council itself.
                </li>
            </ol>

            There are no financial rewards for participation, but the council may allocate some funding to help certain projects. Attending events and proposing events which receive upvotes will count towards your personal social good score on the website, and you can compete with other members of your community on our leaderboard!
